## Summary

I have consistently led efforts ranging from research and development in software test automation and generative AI applications to real-world implementation and business deployment.  
During my tenure at NTT, I directed numerous collaborative projects involving group companies, external partners, and academic institutions, contributing broadly to the deployment of research outcomes into practical services.  
My track record includes over 100 research publications (including top-tier international conferences), more than 50 domestic patents and 20 U.S. patents, and over 20 awards from academic societies and industry organizations.

Currently, I work as a mentor and technical advisor in software development and generative AI utilization,  
providing personalized guidance and hands-on support primarily to individual developers.  
This includes advising on practical engineering challenges related to their professional projects, such as corporate development work and entrepreneurial product development.

In addition, I am actively engaged in technical education and content creation focused on C#  
—including a blog with 20,000+ monthly page views and a YouTube channel with 3,000+ subscribers—  
as well as independent R&D projects such as a real-time debugging framework.

Through these combined activities, I aim to advance software engineering practices  
and contribute to the growth of the next generation of developers.
